This game is a top down shooter where the player controls a sea based turret which must be used to defend against torpedos.

CONTROLS
The player can control the turret by pressing left to move left, right to move right, and the x key to shoot.
The s key is used to start/restart the game.

GAMEPLAY
Once the game starts, torpedos will decend from the top of the screen to the bottom.
The player must destroy as many torpedos as they can, while trying to avoid letting any torpedos hit their turret.
Players gain 100 points for every torpedo destroyed, but lose 50 points for each torpedo which reaches the bottom of the screen.
The game is over when a torpedo hits the players turret.
